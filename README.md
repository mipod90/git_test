This is my very first (mini)-project! The purpose of it is to exercise deconstructing and rebuilding an existing web page. 
The main goal is to learn about element placement on a page and how they get styled and aligned. 
Once I've completed this project I should be able to do basic HTML (general structure of a web page) and CSS (style, design etc.) stuff!
Reporting back once project is finished.
